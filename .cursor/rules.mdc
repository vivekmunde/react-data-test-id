## Architecture & Code Quality
- Use named exports only.
- Export all intended public members at the end of each file.
- Declare each React context in its own dedicated file.

## Design Principles
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Follow DRY (Do not repeat yourself).

## Documentation
- Add IDE IntelliSense-friendly comments and descriptions for every component, hook, and function.
- Document every member of a type, props object, or argument object with a clear comment.
- Add a clear comment for every function argument.

## Testing
- Maintain 100% test coverage.
- Start every test case description with a capital letter.
- Ensure each test case validates a single behavior.
- Prefer importing from `src/index` in tests; use direct file imports only when necessary.

## Naming
- Use dash-case for file names.
- Avoid `data-test-id` as a file name prefix.
- Prefix all type aliases with `T`.
- Suffix all props types with `Props`.
- Suffix all function argument types with `Args`.
- Name context files with a `-context` suffix (e.g., `configuration-context.tsx`).
- Name provider files with a `-provider` suffix (e.g., `configuration-provider.tsx`).
- Name React context values with a `Context` suffix (e.g., `DataTestIdConfigurationContext`).
- Name providers with a `Provider` suffix (e.g., `DataTestIdConfigurationProvider`).

## Components
- Define and export a dedicated props type for every component, hook, and function.
- Use `<React.Fragment>` instead of `<>` fragments.
